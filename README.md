# Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio and blog site, built to showcase my projects and ideas.

## Features
- **Blog** with custom Markdown rendering and editor (currently supports headers and bulleted lists)
- **Dynamic sidebar** inspired by file structures for easy navigation

## Roadmap
Planned features include:
- Expanded Markdown support (lists, code blocks, etc.)

## Purpose
This site is a space to document my work, experiments, and thoughts â€” part portfolio, part blog, and always evolving.
